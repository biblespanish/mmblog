Bible Spanish is founded upon the principle that the Bible can be used to teach all the Spanish needed in everyday life. Verses from the Bible are used as templates upon which to not only learn the verse, but also learn how all the language components of that verse are used in day-to-day situations.

## Bible Spanish is all about:

* Gaining a deeper understanding of the Bible though reading verses in Spanish. Several aspects of the Bible translate better into Spanish than English. For example, the English <em>you</em> does not tell us as much about who is being refered to as much as the Spanish <em>t√∫</em>, <em>usted</em>, and <em>ustedes</em>.
* Looking at the stories in the Bible in a new way. A variety of narratives with many sentence structure types provides numerous opportunities to develop Spanish grammar.
* Learning the Spanish that makes up the verses in the Bible.
* Connecting the timeless Biblical prose with modern Spanish.
* Practicing through effective interactive exercises.
* Building up vocabulary both from the Bible and everyday situations.
